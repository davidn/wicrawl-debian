text_announcement(s):
        This plugin just announces through text to speech the latest
        wicrawl events.  Curently there are just hooks for new discovery,
        have IP, and have internet.  It requires 'flite' (festival lite
        from Carnegie Mellon) which can be found here (and of course any
        of its requirements, like a working soundcard, etc):

                http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/

        You can enable each hook independently, so if you only want to be
        notified when you can get to the internet, just enable the hook in
        only the appropriate hook directory.

        Like the other hooks, this is not enabled by default (it can get a
        bit annoying after a while, =).  One bug (I guess) is that
        announcments are not queued, so if one announcement happens during
        another, the second is not played (since the DSP device is busy).
        We could add locking here, but generally I'm not sure that I want
        that many announcments played.  If you want this announcment
        queueing feature, put in a request and we can fix it.
