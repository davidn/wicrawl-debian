This is a plugin for ettercap, which is (according to the site) a "suite for
man in the middle attacks on LAN.  It features sniffing of live connections,
content filtering on the fly and many other interesting tricks."

The plugin requires the ettercap is already installed on the system, and is in
the $PATH.  The default configuration will run ettercap for 5 minutes to
collect users/passwords, and any other target data that it collects.  You can
configure extra options in the plugin in the plugin.conf.  These are the
default configurable options:

This is to specify extra attacks, or ettercap plugins.  To see a list of extra
attacks available, try ettercap -P list

	"ettercap_extra_attacks" => "",


Any extra parameters you want passed to ettercap on the command line

	"ettercap_extra_cli_parameters" => "",


Setting this to '1' will configure ettercap to only run against the .pcap file
collected during discovery, and don't actively sniff the network now.

	"ettercap_run_pcap_only" => "0";


The length of time to run ettercap (in seconds)

	"ettercap_runtime" => "300"

This plugin was tested against the 0.7.3 version of ettercap.  Thanks to the
ettercap developers for a great tool.
