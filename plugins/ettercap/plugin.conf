# Plugin specific configuration
#       These vars will get set in the environment before they plugin is run
#       you can use this within the plugin to configure things without
#       needing to hard-code it or create your own config file
#
#       They need to be set in key/value pairs in a config style similar to
#       the perl hash format seen below:

%plugin_env= ( 
		# To see a list of extra attacks available, try
		# ettercap -P list
              "ettercap_extra_attacks" => "",

		# extra parameters passed to ettercap on the command line
              "ettercap_extra_cli_parameters" => "",

		# Only run ettercap against the .pcap file collected during
		# discovery, and don't sniff the network now
              "ettercap_run_pcap_only" => "0";

		# The length of time to run ettercap (in seconds)
              "ettercap_runtime" => "300"
             );

# This is to make sure perl evaluates the config files properly
