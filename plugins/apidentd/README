APIdentd is a plugin for Wicrawl that will report the manufacturer of any found
access points by comparing the vendor code of the BSSID to a list of known
vendor codes.  It takes the input from a filtered version of the ieee oui
database text file directly.

Run the update-oui-headers.sh script to get the latest list directly from IEEE.
