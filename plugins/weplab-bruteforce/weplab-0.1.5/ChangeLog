        * 2005-07-18. weplab 0.1.5
		- Stupid bug with small packets (like arp) fixed. Minimun size
		decreased to 20 bytes. Now weplab works like a charm with a
		arp replay attack (aireplay).
		- Prints the right ascii password when a key is cracked using
		the dictionary mode.
	* 2005-03-01. weplab 0.1.4
		- Fixed a bug in bruteforge.c and implemented a new way to coordinate multiple process cracking.
		- Fixed a bug in bruteforge.c now --ascii goes up to 0x7F.
		- Only support for --alpha (only letters) and --alnum (letters and numbers) in the bruteforce attack.
		- Now wlan0 is the default interface for capturing packets.
		- 'q' quits sniffing and flushes the pcap file.
		- Simplified help for command line parameters
		- Fixed some divide by 0 bugs
		- Added --wordfile. Now it is possible to launch the dictionary based attack without using John the Ripper to generate words.

        * 2004-12-07. weplab 0.1.3
		- Fixed a bug with those WEP keys which have a 0xFF byte value
		- Fixed bug that made weplab show wrong BSSID with --analyze (Thanks Rubio9)
		- Fixed problem with --ascii in bruteforce attack (Thanks Gforkel)
		- Now weplab have a manual page! (generated from xml file).
		- Minor bugs fixed related to console printed messages.
		- Name "beta" is no longer in weplab's version. Although the project still remain in beta stage.

	* 2004-09-11. weplab 0.1.2-beta
		- Default options for statistical attack changed. Now [ -s 3 --perc 50 ] by default
		- Command line options are more relaxed and robust.
		- PRISM_HEADER datalink added for capture packets.
		- Dictionary attack little fix. It is tested and works fine with John The Ripper 1.6

	* 2004-09-09. weplab 0.1.1-beta
		- Automatic BSSID detection and selection if not specified with --bssid.
		- Analyze (-a) now shows all packets per BSSID.
		- Big endian issues fixed
		- Little fixes for windows platform

	* 2004-08-29. weplab 0.1.0-beta
		- Small bug fixed with rc4 decryption
		- Korek inverse attack little change.

	* 2004-08-29. weplab 0.0.9-beta
		- Full Korek's attacks implemented. New command line option -s let's you specify minimun stability required
		- Dictionary attack implemented (uzy) but not fully tested
		- Now rejected bytes are never tested
		- Minor bugs fixed and speed inprovements in bruteforce attack

	* 2004-08-22. weplab 0.0.8-beta
	- Added new statistical attacks (Korek's attacks). Now it is possible to crack the key even with less than 500k packets
    - Fixed bug with second byte attack. Remains to be tested in deep
    - Added BSSID detection
    - Added information about the time needed to crack the current key. For benchmarking purposes
    - Some minor fixes in README file and Help.

	* 2004-07-01. weplab 0.0.7-beta
    - Fixed bug recognizing AMD Athlon XP processor on configure script
    - Fixed one small-big bug. Forgot to printf the key when it was found in bruteforce mode.
    - Some spanish messages are now translated into english
    - Fixed small bug in the number of keybytes showed with --debugkey
    - Fix a bug with 0 bytes data length packets
    - Restructuration of the source code. Now statistical attacks (like FMS) are located in attack.c.
    	It is easier to modify or add custom attacks modifying this file.
    - Added the possibility to specify desired statistical attacks to be launched from command line (--attacks 1,2)
    - Attack to byte 2 dissabled by default as it is BUGGY. Will be reviewed and fixed in future releases.

	* 2004-06-23. weplab 0.0.6-alpha
		- Fixed bug in --debugkey with 128-bit keys
		- Detection of --prismheader in --analyze
		- Fixed segmentation fault when --prismheader is used when it is not needed
		- Fixed small ./configure issue with libpcap. Now it will exit with warning if libpcap is not present.

	* 2004-06-19. weplab 0.0.5-alpha
		- Small fixes
		- Multiprocessor support for bruteforce (-m)
	* 2004-06-14. weplab 0.0.4-alpha
		- Little stupid error with prismheader

	* 2004-06-14. weplab 0.0.3-alpha
		- debugkey correct key detection error fix
		- configure microprocessor detection improvements
		- debugkey parser error fix
		- prismheader error fixed
		- bruteforce last FF error fixed
		- Little bug fixed

	* 2004-06-08. weplab 0.0.2-alpha
		- added smart custom probabilistic branch selector for FMS attack.
		- Little bug fixed

	* 2004-06-03. weplab 0.0.1-alpha: first non-released beta
