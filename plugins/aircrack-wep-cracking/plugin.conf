# Plugin specific configuration
#       These vars will get set in the environment before they plugin is run
#       you can use this within the plugin to configure things without
#       needing to hard-code it or create your own config file
#
#       They need to be set in key/value pairs in a config style similar to
#       the perl hash format seen below:

%plugin_env= ( 
		# whether to use the ptw attack or not..
              "aircrack_use_ptw_attack" => "1",
		# The fudge factor we use for aircrack
              "aircrack_fudge_factor" => "6",
		# Whether to deauth all clients or not
              "aircrack_deauth_all_clients" => "1",
		# Whether to deauth clients more than once if we're not seeing enough traffic
              "aircrack_deauth_only_once" => "1"
             );

# This is to make sure perl evaluates the config files properly
