README: Aircrack plugin for wicrawl

This plugin automates a typical aircrack run.  It tries to do the following:
	- Start monitor mode on the interface
	- Start airodump-ng 
	- Look for clients participating on the given network
	- Send deauth to the broadcast
	- Send a deauth to each client we can see
	- If after some time we still don't have a client, re-deauth
	- Runs aireplay-ng --fakeauth attacks with the client MAC
		- If fakeauth attacks fail, then reselect the best client
		  and restart fakeauth and arpinject processes
	- Runs aireplay-ng --arpinject attacks to inject traffic and generate IVs
		- If we still aren't getting arp traffic after a while, re-run de-auth
	- Runs aircrack-ng once we get enough traffic.

The plugin should output the current status for how many arp injections we've
done, how many IVs we have so far.  How long we estimate it to take (based on
500,000 IVs for normal, or 20,000 with ptw), and how cracking is going.

There is some configuration in the plugin.conf to specify whether we want to
use the PTW attacks, what fudge factor to use, and whether to send a deauth to
every client.  aircrack_deauth_only_once is whether we should keep trying to
deauth everyonce in a while if we're not seeing any arp, or clients aren't
showing as associated.  aircrack_deauth_never means it will never send a deauth.
	"aircrack_use_ptw_attack" => "1",
	"aircrack_fudge_factor" => "6"
	"aircrack_deauth_all_clients" => "1"
	"aircrack_deauth_only_once" => "1"
	"aircrack_deauth_never" => "0"

The next step for this plugin would be to to add chopchop/fragmentation
attacks automatically, but this is basically what wesside does, so use that
plugin if you want to use this method.
