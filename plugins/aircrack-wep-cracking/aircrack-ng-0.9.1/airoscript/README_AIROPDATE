Airopdate is a simple shell script that allows you to get various versions of aircrack-ng, airoscript and drivers for multiple wifi devices.

It's divided in 4 sections

aircrack-ng	allows you to get any version of aircrack-ng : stable, latest svn, latest 1.0-dev,or a specific revision
drivers		allows you to install drivers automatically. For now only a few drivers are supported.
airoscript	allows you to get the latest version of airoscript (works with latest rev, maybe on other too)
quit		exits the script and return you to your shell.
