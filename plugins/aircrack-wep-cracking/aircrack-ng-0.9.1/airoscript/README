ABOUT:
Airoscript is a shell script designed to ease the use of aircrack-ng. It allows
you to: scan, select and attack any detected access point. This is done by
detecting encryption type and proposing attacks accordingly. Various attacks
are available, such as: chopchop, fragmentation attack, fakeauth, deauth,
dictionnary attacks and WPA cracking.

REQUIREMENTS:
aircrack-ng version 0.7
WORKING injection capable driver for the interface you want to use

STATUS:
Airoscript is currently in an unstable state.

USAGE:
Before doing anything make sure to open airoscript in a text editor
and set all variable according to your environnement.
The most important variables are:

# The TROUBLESHOOTING debug mod (1 for enable, 0 for disable)
DEBUG="0"
# Your interface: wlan0, ath0 etc... (if not set airoscript will ask for one
at every launch of it)
WIFI=""
# The path where the data is stored (FOLDER MUST EXIST !)
DUMP_PATH="/wifi"

First you need to enable execution of the script by doing:

"chmod +x airoscript.sh"

be sure to have root access and then you can run it by typing:

"./airoscript.sh"

COMPILATION:
a shell script doesnt need to be compiled, but it can be put into bin folder
to allow it to be run from anywhere.

DEVELOPERS:
Help and feedback is greatly appreciated. Please feel free to mail me at
daouid@gmail.com for any suggestion or correction.
I will be pleased to add you to the contributors of airoscript.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Warning messages when using XTERM

ABOUT COMPLIANCE:
In the wrong hands, airoscript and aircrack-ng could easily violate the 
government certification of your radio.  A simple example is running injection
on frequencies your radio isn't certified for in your geographic region.

you and only you are responsible for making sure that your tools -- including
airoscript -- are compliant with the regulations in your country and region.

There is also forum thread in aircrack-ng official forum where you can ask 
questions, or just get updates, support etc.
