Changelog for 1.7RC4 (13/09/2006)
-corrected minor speellling issues ;o) 
-added aircrack-ng version detection function currently all it does is display aircrack version in the menu function (should be useful when new functionality is added to aircrack to allow backwards compatibility)
-added solointeractiveattack function (designed to run just the airreplay interactive attack function only for use with an attack that has stalled i.e. data has stopped increasing, the user can try this for another injection thread! (might not actually work?? needs more testing does spawn and seems to work!)
-added option to manually add ssid if a blank ssid is detected (this has some problems when certain editors are used as this is not strictly blank but a non printable character recommend kwrite on Back|track to edit script)
