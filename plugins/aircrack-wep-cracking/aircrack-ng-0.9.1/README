OpenWrt Devices
---------------

You can use airodump-ng on OpenWrt devices. You'll have to use specify
prism0 as interface. Airodump-ng will automatically create it.
Rq: Aireplay DOESN'T work on OpenWrt with broadcom chipset since the driver doesn't support injection


Other issue:
------------

Problem: Airodump-ng stop working after some time
Solution: You may have a network manager running that puts back the card in managed mode. 
          You'll have to disable it (the fastest solution is killing the process) then restart airodump-ng.


Madwifi-ng known bugs:
----------------------

Problem: When changing rate while you are capturing packet makes airodump-ng stall
Solution: Restart airodump-ng or change rate before starting it

Problem: After some time it stops capturing packets and you're really sure no network manager are running at all.
Solution: That's a known bug in the driver, it may happen at any time
          (I saw that at 5 minutes for someone and at 50 for someone else, it can even be more).
