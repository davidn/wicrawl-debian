# Plugin specific configuration
#       These vars will get set in the environment before they plugin is run
#       you can use this within the plugin to configure things without
#       needing to hard-code it or create your own config file
#
#       They need to be set in key/value pairs in a config style similar to
#       the perl hash format seen below:

%plugin_env= ( 
		# This selects which targets you'd like to run nmap against
		# once you've connected to a network
		# valid values are:
		# 	"gateway" # This will scan just the gateway you connect to
		#                 # Many times for consumer grade APs, this will be the 
		#                 # address of the AP itself
		#
		#       "network" # This will scan the entire network
              "nmap_scan_targets" => "network",

		# This is the type of scan that you want to do. By default it is
		# a syn scan.  From the man page, here are some other options:
		#
		#    -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
		#    -sU: UDP Scan
		#    -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
		#
              "nmap_scan_type" => "-sS",

		# Any extra options you want to send nmap (e.g. -g 20, or -P0), put it here
              "nmap_extra_options" => "-n -A -T4"
             );

# This is to make sure perl evaluates the config files properly
