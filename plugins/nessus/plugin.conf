# Plugin specific configuration
#       These vars will get set in the environment before they plugin is run
#       you can use this within the plugin to configure things without
#       needing to hard-code it or create your own config file
#
#       They need to be set in key/value pairs in a config style similar to
#       the perl hash format seen below:

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Note, you must uncomment and fill in the lines below for the nessus plugin to work:
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#%plugin_env= ( 
#              "nessus_user" => "myusername",
#              "nessus_pass" => "mypassword"
#             );

# This is to make sure perl evaluates the config files properly
