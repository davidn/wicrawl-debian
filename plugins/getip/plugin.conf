#       These vars will get set in the environment before they plugin is run
#       you can use this within the plugin to configure things without
#       needing to hard-code it or create your own config file
#
#       They need to be set in key/value pairs in a config style similar to
#       the perl hash format seen below:

# Change the IP address of Buddy IP sitting somewhere on a public IP address
%plugin_env= ( 
              "buddy_ip" => "4.3.2.1",
             );

# This is to make sure perl evaluates the config files properly
