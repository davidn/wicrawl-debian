Getip plugin will attempt to obtain access point's external internet
ip address by using easside and norsside to inject UDP traffic into
encrypted and unencrypted networks to a buddy server listening on a
public ip somewhere on the internet. The buddy server will in turn
provide us the source ip address of an access point sending us
injected UDP traffic. 

With this in mind, you must have access to the internet to gain access 
to the buddy-server or host buddy-server on your own box which will be
accessible by the access point through its wan interface (e.g. you have
evdo card with a public ip address which can be used to host buddy
server). It does not make sense to use IP address on a local network
since it will not provide access point's public ip address.

Please specify the ip address of buddy server in plugin.conf file.
Below is a sample configuration of buddy-ip address being 4.3.2.1:

%plugin_env= ( 
              "buddy_ip" => "4.3.2.1",
             );
             
It is suggested that you edit /etc/wicrawl/wicrawl.conf to set $enableMadwifiHack=1;
in order for injection to work properly.

Next follow these steps:
1) run wicrawl and set interface (ath0 in my case)
2) run wicrawl in discovery mode first
3) leave checkmarks next to "interesting" APs
4) select "getip" profile from drop down
5) run wicrawl in "manual mode" and watch IPs coming ;-)
