This is a plugin that will bruteforce wpa pre-shared keys based on a dictionary
attack.  It uses cowpatty, and requires that john the ripper is already
installed.  It will first try the pcap file that was created by discovery, and
then will run tcpdump until it finds a handshake, and will then run coWPAtty on
it.

Thanks to Josh Wright and all the other people involved in it for doing all the
hard work by creating CoWPAtty, :).  See cowpatty/README for more details on it.
