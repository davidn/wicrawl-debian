Soekris engineering makes a crypto accelerator.  If someone feels generous
enough to drop the $75/US on it and send it to me, I'd see about implementing
support to improve performance by using this card to offload processing.

Alternatively, I'm always receptive to systems with high-end processors as
well. ;)

Drop me a note at jwright@hasborg.com if you are interested.  Thanks!
