Gpsd:
        GPSD is a hook that will take the current coordinate information
        from gpsd, and place it in the xml file which gets put into the
        wicrawl GUI.   It is implemented in perl, and has some
        dependencies:
                Net::GPSD
                gpsd

        You can get the perl module by doing:

          perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::GPSD';

        and GPSD itself comes from here:
          http://gpsd.berlios.de/

        Though you probably have native packages in your distribution
        (debian and ubuntu do anyway, and they have .rpm's on the site for
        download).

        As long as your GPS unit is supported by GPSD, then it should work
        fine with wicrawl.
