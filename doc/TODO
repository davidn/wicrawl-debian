Discovery:
	- Get WPA data and send to discovery
	- Support for ralink devices (rt73 driver)
	- Test multi-card simultaneous discovery, split the channels between
	  the two cards.
	- Gather and quantify card-specific functionality
		- use lorcon?
	- Grab actual traffic and record IP info IP info is important if we
	  want to use it to seed authorized MAC finding
	- Traffic "filters" that can be registered per plugin, and a match flag
	  in the IPC (partially done).

Plugin-engine:
	- Handle WEP/WPA better
	- Put plugin dependencies in the plugin.conf
	- Use the card-specific functionality in scheduling and plugins
	  (especially madwifi)
	- Fix annoying @@basedir@@ crap
	- Support for different types of rendered text output (like html/pdf)
	- Make the FIFO a network link so we can have multiple nodes.  Also, we
	  need to add a IPC message for the host computer.

Plugins:
	- Push more config options into plugin.conf instead of plugin scripts
	- FPGA picocrack plugin
	- file snarfing (network and network-share) plugin
	- Spectrum analyzer wi-spy plugin
	- Figure out why text to speech has output twice
	- Metasploit plugin
	- Merge cowpatty trees, and fix radiotap
	- Wesside plugin
	- Coordinates -> KML 
	- Fix nessus plugin to have config to scan either AP or local subnet

General:
	- Push some of the common actions (like associate, and dhcp) into a
	  central program (apcore?)
	- Need a central repository with a super simple interface to share info
	  like:
		- mac addresses on a given AP
	- Need to automagically bring up wireless interfaces (so they don't
	  have to be "up" previous to starting wicrawl).
	- RPM & DEB packages
	- Pull out common functions between plugin-engine and UI (.pm's?)
	- Documentation
		- Man pages
		- HTML "manual" ?

UI:
	- GUI
		- Allow card list to be "refreshed" in GUI
		- Change "Start in Manual Mode"
		      To "Start Selected APs" or something similar
		- Allow user to scroll in output windows while running
		- Fix "jerky" output windows while running
	- TUI
		- Test
		- See if the curses UI plugins can be included easily
