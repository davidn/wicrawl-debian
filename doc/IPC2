Overview:

The IPC2 subsystem is an implementation of a stream based protocol
used for bidirectional communication with apcore, the wicrawl
discovery engine.  The IPC2 subsystem complements the IPC fifo used
for unidirectional communication of discovered radios to the plugin
engine.

To enable IPC2, simply pass --ipc2 or -s to apcore, followed by the
name of a unix socket to create.  

To talk to the IPC2 socket, connect to it like any UNIX socket and
issue a valid IPC2 command.

IPC2 Command list:

filter STRING: set the current pcap filter string to STRING.  If
STRING is omitted, no filter string will be applied and all frames
will be analyzed.

shutdown: immediately shutdown apcore.

version: respond with apcore's version number.  This can be used to
infer apcore's support for certain IPC2 messages.
