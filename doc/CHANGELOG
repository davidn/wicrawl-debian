Trunk
- plugin-engine
	- fixed wicrawl.conf parsing (for madwifihack)
	- fixed manual mode channels
- apcore
	- Added -c flag for channel restriction.
	- Added -n flag to leave the monitor state alone.  This works around a bug
	  aaronp reports with the madwifi drivers, where setting monitor mode on a
	  monitor mode VAP causes the driver to stop passing frames to the VAP.
	- Added version and filter IPC2 messages.

v0.4
- Plugin-engine
        - Added -I flag to allow filters to be passed in a newline delimted file
        - Added hack for mad-wifi so it doesn't try to schedule the monitor
          interface between plugin runs (because channel hoping on the monitor
          mode interface will prevent the station mode interface from working
          properly).
        - Added -K flag to allow for external discovery
	- Can read the "kill discovery between plugin runs" from the profile
	  (in addition to the -k flag)
	- plugine-engine now runs plugins/hooks asynchronously when configured in
	  the plugin config (this means no output is gathered however).
	- Added test_ipc.pl script to test plugin-engine and UI
	- Added to_ipc($ipcfile) method to AccessPoint.pm so that anything using this module
	  can serialize the data directly to the IPC mechanism.
	- Added dynamic logging for plugins (so we can see output in the GUI mid-run)
- Plugins
	- Text to speech
		- Added locking file
		- Changed to be asynchronous (was slowing down discovery)
	- APidentD
		- Updaed OUI database
		- Added script to update the OUI db from the IEEE db
	- Ettercap
		- Added new ettercap plugin
