/**
 * struct iw_range for wireless API version 18.  We use this for
 * performing the SIOCGIWRANGE ioctl, because then we don't need to
 * rely on the version in /usr/include/linux being correct.
 *
 * Basically, the SIOCGIWRANGE ioctl expects the iw_point.length
 * member to be the size of the struct iw_range the kernel was
 * compiled with.  Since the r17 version of this structure is one
 * member shorter than the r18 version, things break if the r17
 * headers are installed in /usr/include/linux and the kernel is using
 * r18.  This is a situation that's easy to run into after a few
 * kernel upgrades on some distributions.
